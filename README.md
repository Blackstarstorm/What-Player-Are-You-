# What-Player-Are-You?

### Some people just render me of a game genewand sometimes I wonder what kind of genre who represent myself. Some site/apps have test to see what character you are close to, so why can't there be on for game genres?

### This app will let user take a quiz and  get result telling you want game genre you're most like, why you might enjoy this genre and some games associated with it.
