# What-Player-Are-You?

### Some people just render me of a game gene and sometimes I wonder what kind of genre would best represent myself. Some site/apps have test to see what character you are most likely to be, so why can't there be on for game genres?

### This app lets you learn more about game genres and some games that are commonly associated with that genre. You will also be able to add games to genres of games. Never forget about games that you love

### !!!!!!Not all game genres will be in this app sadly since there are a lot of genres/sub-genres/hybrid-genres. Forgive me I love gaming, but it would get messy and crazy if all genres where in here. I will have more of an umbrella term with the genres.
